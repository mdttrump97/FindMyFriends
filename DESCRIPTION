Title: Microbial Comparative Genomics in R
Version: 1.17.0
Date: 2016-10-06
Author: Thomas Lin Pedersen
Maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen <thomasp85@gmail.com>
Description: A framework for doing microbial comparative genomics in R.
    The main purpose of the package is assisting in the creation of
    pangenome matrices where genes from related organisms are
    grouped by similarity, as well as the analysis of these data.
    FindMyFriends provides many novel approaches to doing pangenome
    analysis and supports a gene grouping algorithm that scales
    linearly, thus making the creation of huge pangenomes feasible.
